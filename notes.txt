Functions:
Functions are important because they save time. The goal should be to 
minimize the amount of time wasted copying and pasting code, or repeating 
a set of code over and over again. Functions give us the convenience of 
typing a set of code that performs a set of tasks wrapped in block of 
function like a tool. And then if we need that specific tool, we simply 
call that function to perform that set of task. Functions reduce the 
number of lines of code too.
Also, if we need to update the set of instructions in the functions, we 
go to that function and update, this also helps us to update or correct 
the set of code in one place and the changes are going to reflect in all 
other areas wherever that specific function was called, thus saving a huge 
amount of time and effort.
